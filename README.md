# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

2. Input Data: The app displays:
  - Total Classes conducted
  - Required Percentage (typically 70-75%)
  - Classes Attended - input the value you actually attended the classes.
  - Classes Held - input the value, number of classes actually held.
3. Claculation Logic

```
Present % = (Classes Attended / Classes Held) Ã— 100
Max Bunk Classes = Classes that can be skipped while maintaining required percentage
```
